# Grafana Setup

## Prerequisites

* Terraform installed on your machine
* Docker installed on your machine

## Setup

1. Initialize the Terraform working directory: `terraform init`
2. Create a `terraform.tfvars` file with the following content:
```plaintext
admin_user = "your_admin_user"
admin_password = "your_admin_password"
Replace `your_admin_user` and `your_admin_password` with your desired values.
3. Apply the Terraform configuration: `terraform apply`
4. Once the deployment is complete, you can access Grafana at `http://localhost:3000`

## Using the Setup

* Log in to Grafana with the admin user and password you set in the `terraform.tfvars` file.
* You can now add dashboards, users, and data sources as needed.

## Notes

* This setup uses a local Docker volume for persistent storage. If you want to use a different storage solution, you can modify the `main.tf` file accordingly.
* Make sure to keep your `terraform.tfvars` file secure, as it contains sensitive information (admin user and password).

You can now use the `terraform apply` command to deploy Grafana to your local machine, and access it at `http://localhost:3000`.
